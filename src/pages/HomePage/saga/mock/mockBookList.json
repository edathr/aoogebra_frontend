      "description": "Although 91 years old, Deng Xiaoping is still believed to be the most powerful leader in China. Widely considered responsible for China's rapid economic growth, political reform, and open-door policy since the late Seventies, he is also linked to the Tiananmen Massacre in Beijing in June 1993. He thus represents a paradox, an enigma to the outside world. Goodman's political biography gives a detailed explanation of the relationship between these two images. Deng is characterized as a &#x22;committed communist&#x22; with a pragmatic view, who would like to bring forth China's modernization through the &#x22;organizational&#x22; rather than &#x22;ideological&#x22; leadership of the Communist party. The author's approach is more analytical and scholarly than Richard Evan's in Deng Xiaoping and the Making of Modern China (LJ 1/94). Recommended for academic libraries. [Librarians may also wish to consider a recent account by Deng's daughter Deng Maomao, Deng Xiaoping: My Father, LJ 1/95.?Ed.]?Mark Meng, St. John's Univ. Lib., New Yor.-?Mark Meng, St. John's Univ.
